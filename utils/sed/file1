Although Unix is well known today, Unix was not known 
outside of technical circles in the 1980s.  I worked
for a company that was hiring technical writers in 
the mid 1980s.  An interviewer asked a candidate, who 
was a high school English teacher, if she knew Unix.  
Having never heard of the operating system, but knowing 
a word that was a homonym, she was unnerved.
