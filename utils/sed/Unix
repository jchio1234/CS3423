Unix has been around since 1971, but Unix didn't
become popular until AT&T made the source for Unix 
System V purchasable in the 1980s.  

In the late 1980s, I worked for a company doing contract 
work for the U.S. Army.  We used Unix, C, and the Informix 
DBMS.  Although UTSA CS students were not taught Unix 
at that time, we hired over 30 UTSA graduates since 
they were able to come up to speed in Unix in less 
than a week.

Although Unix is well known today, Unix was not known 
outside of technical circles in the 1980s.  Our company 
was hiring technical writers.  An interviewer asked 
a candidate, who was a high school Enlish teacher, if she 
knew Unix.  Having never heard of the operating system
and having heard of a similar sounding word,
she was unnerved.

Having never heard of the operating system, but knowing 
a word that was a homonym, she was unnerved.
